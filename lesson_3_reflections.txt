When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Prehaps if you were working live and collaboratively you could start a project this way on GitHub. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
In case of sharing files, one might want to make local files more final or operational instead of automatically pushing them to the remote or vice/versa.
